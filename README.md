# Capex Ledger

A pipeline that takes a company's 10-K filings and returns revenue, capex and opex, each citing the exact cell it came from. AI agents read, code checks every citation, rules encode the judgement, XBRL serves as a free answer key, and a person reviews and signs each release. Success is measured by what the next company costs, not by how many are done.

## Status

*Updated with every commit.*

**Last done (28 Oct 2026):** M1 is done. AMD, a company the pipeline had never seen, ran from ticker to finished validation page with nobody in the loop: `ledger run --ticker AMD`, 21 seconds end to end.
- **Agent:** 2 10-Ks read by the headless agent (Opus 5.5, 0.5 agent-minutes, 16k tokens, 0 retries).
- **Results:** 12/12 values agree with XBRL, and 24/24 cited cells were confirmed on the rendered 10-K. 0 of 120 injected faults escaped.
- **Cost:** 0 code changes and 0 items for a person. There are 3 warnings, all FY2026 coverage: AMD's FY2026 hasn't ended yet.
- **Scorecard:** in [docs/INGESTION.md](docs/INGESTION.md) and on `reports/AMD-validation.html`.
- `v0.2.0` stays signed.

**Next:**
1. **Claude (M2):** label "the fiscal year hasn't ended" in code, then run the remaining 13 unseen companies blind with the pipeline frozen (`ledger run --ticker GOOGL AMZN META TSLA MU SPCX MRVL ALAB CRDO IREN CIFR WULF CORZ`). Record each failure by type and fix the type, then rerun everything.
2. **Kenny (optional):** upgrade the installed Claude Code with `brew upgrade claude-code` (or your install method), so that `LEDGER_CLAUDE` isn't needed.

**Critical notes:**
- **Dashes are zero.** APLD's newest 10-K shows "—" for its data-center cost line in FY2024 and FY2025; agents read these as 0.
- **NVDA's capex line includes intangible assets.** Note it when comparing companies.
- **Known blind spot:** a wrong-row misread is caught by comparing a company's filings with each other, so a company's first filing is less protected.
- **Running agents:** `ledger run` runs the agent headless on Kenny's subscription (no paid API). It needs a logged-in `claude` (run `claude`, then `/login`) of version 2.1.280 or later for Opus 5.5. Until the installed one is upgraded, set `LEDGER_CLAUDE` to the desktop app's newer `claude`.
- **Old work is in tags:**
  - `takehome-xbrl-explorer`: the 113-company explorer
  - `quarterly-v0.1`: the quarterly pipeline

## How it works

| Step | Command | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| Run | `run --ticker X` | All steps below for any tickers, agent included, then the scorecard |
| Ingest | `ingest` | 10-Ks fetched and cached with SHA-256; tables parsed; statements located |
| Extract | `extract --pack`, then agents, then `extract --load` | One task per 10-K (tables only, no XBRL); agent values with citations, each checked against the cell |
| Reconcile | `reconcile` | Fiscal-year values with their basis and first-reported figure, compared with XBRL |
| Rules | `rules` | Exceptions from the 14 rules in `rules/*.yaml` |
| Faults | `faults` | Every cell corrupted in typical ways, and what caught each |
| Evidence | `evidence` | Every cited cell re-read on the 10-K rendered in Chrome; boxed screenshots in `reports/evidence/` (`--faults` proves it notices moved citations) |
| Report | `report` | `reports/stage<N>-validation.html`: plain-language review page and hand-check |
| Review | `review`, `review decide` | `decisions/decisions.jsonl`; a decision counts only while its inputs are unchanged |
| Release | `release <v>` | `releases/<v>/`; refuses while any gate fails, and the same inputs give the same hash |
| Sign | `signoff <v> --by` | `SIGNOFF.json` |

Every command runs as `uv run python -m ledger <command> --stage N` or `--ticker X Y`. `evidence` drives the installed Google Chrome through Playwright, with no browser download. The XBRL reference is pulled with `python -m ledger reference`.
