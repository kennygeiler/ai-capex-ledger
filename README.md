# Capex Ledger

A pipeline that takes a company's 10-K filings and returns revenue, capex and opex, each citing the exact cell it came from. AI agents read, code checks every citation, rules encode the judgement, XBRL serves as a free answer key, and a person reviews and signs each release. Success is measured by what the next company costs, not by how many are done.

## Status

*Updated with every commit.*

**Last done (28 Oct 2026):** the DATAHQ dashboard shows only numbers that ask for an action or explain why the data can be trusted.
- **Values accounted for:** 234 of 234 (224 match the SEC's data, 6 explained by code, 4 decided by Kenny, 0 waiting). A value waiting on a person turns it red.
- **Release:** whether the latest signed release is still what the pipeline would ship (0 values changed since `v1.0.1`); red with a count when it isn't.
- **Next 10-K** and **agent cost per company** (0.7 min, 28.7K tokens, average of 17 companies read headless).
- Companies sorted by what needs attention; open warnings by check. Removed: cells-confirmed and fault-test tiles (still in the pipeline bars), the separate next-10-K table, and per-company cost columns (on the Agents page).
- Earlier today: grouped warning review, evidence from every run, blank reasons in Outputs; `v1.0.1` signed.

**Next:** the demo goal is met: a working pipeline with oversight (agents read, code checks, a person decides and signs, every step visible in DATAHQ). Optional, only if needed:
1. New-filing watcher: check SEC daily for new 10-Ks and run `ledger run` on them.
2. Make the hand-check file name match `release` for single-ticker runs.
3. `DIFF.md` lists added values; prompt `statements@v3` (v2 still explains quarterly columns; needs an agent rerun).

**Critical notes:**
- **Dashes are zero.** APLD's newest 10-K shows "—" for its data-center cost line in FY2024 and FY2025; agents read these as 0.
- **NVDA's capex line includes intangible assets.** Note it when comparing companies.
- **Known blind spot:** a wrong-row misread is caught by comparing a company's filings with each other, so a company's first filing is less protected.
- **Running agents:** `ledger run` runs the agent headless on Kenny's subscription (no paid API). It needs a logged-in `claude` (run `claude`, then `/login`) of version 2.1.280 or later for Opus 5.5. Until the installed one is upgraded, set `LEDGER_CLAUDE` to the desktop app's newer `claude`.
- **Old work is in tags:**
  - `takehome-xbrl-explorer`: the 113-company explorer
  - `quarterly-v0.1`: the quarterly pipeline

## How it works

| Step | Command | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| Run | `run --ticker X` | All steps below for any tickers, agent included, then the scorecard |
| Ingest | `ingest` | 10-Ks from FY2022 on, fetched and cached with SHA-256; tables parsed; statements located; the XBRL answer key built for each company |
| Extract | `extract --run`, then `extract --load` | One task per 10-K (tables only, no XBRL); the headless agent's values with citations, each checked against the cell |
| Reconcile | `reconcile` | Fiscal-year values with their basis and first-reported figure, compared with XBRL |
| Rules | `rules` | Exceptions from the 15 rules in `rules/*.yaml` |
| Faults | `faults` | Every cell corrupted in typical ways, and what caught each |
| Evidence | `evidence` | Every cited cell re-read on the 10-K rendered in Chrome; boxed screenshots in `reports/evidence/` (`--faults` proves it notices moved citations) |
| Report | `report` | `reports/<name>-validation.html` (`stage2`, `AMD`): plain-language review page, scorecard and checks |
| Review | `review`, `review decide` | `decisions/decisions.jsonl`; a decision counts only while its inputs are unchanged |
| Release | `release <v>` | `releases/<v>/`; refuses while any gate fails, and the same inputs give the same hash |
| Sign | `signoff <v> --by` | `SIGNOFF.json` |
| App | `app` | DATAHQ at http://127.0.0.1:3610: dashboard, each company through every step, the agents (model, prompt versions, every run), outputs explorer with CSV export |

Every command runs as `uv run python -m ledger <command> --stage N` or `--ticker X Y` (release and signoff take a stage). `evidence` drives the installed Google Chrome through Playwright, with no browser download.
